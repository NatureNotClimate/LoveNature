      <description>When one organism lives off another organism without benefitting it, we call that parasitism. In nature, parasites often only consume an optimal part of the production output of an organism, preferably without the host noticing. Parasites target a balance between their gain and danger to the host. Taking too much can endanger the ecosystem of the parasites. In society, there are whole classes of people with little output of their own, some wielding great power without responsibility.</description>

      <description>Nowhere in nature will you find evidence of damage because of a hotter climate. Seasides haven&amp;rsquo;t expanded, species have not moved or went extinct becasue of that. All human related extinctions are due to habitat loss or poaching. After 200 years of CO2 increasing, there are only predictions, nothing real has happened yet. Temperature measurements of the last years are much lower than predicted with the scary models.

      <description>Watching the destruction of our planet on the travels to tropical expeditions is rough. It always hurts, and it makes many of us biologists cynical about the future. When in the tropics, we are constantly terrorized by the destruction of what we love and therefore study. It is like we are forced to watch our loved ones suffer. Most of us know very well that the most people’s love for nature has been hijacked and that this is the result.</description>

      <title>What Is Wrong With the Future of Energy</title>

      <description>&amp;ndash; Swindling with the future of energy &amp;ndash; I find it difficult to accept that in our modern technological society, we promote the use of old and outdated technologies such as solar cells and wind driven dynamo’s. These sources of energy are inferior to what we are currently capable of. Oddly enough, during what is perceived a crisis, the climate lobby has turned the tables on technology, which is now following the lead of swindlers.</description>
