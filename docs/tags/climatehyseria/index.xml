      <description>As a practicing nature protector, I spend lots of time in nature. I see tons of destruction going on - right now. Fire, chainsaw, &amp;hellip; heart-breaking. What I never see is any sign of damage caused by climate change. None. It&amp;rsquo;s not there. But the destruction is real, and accellerating. What on earth is going on?
Seasides haven&amp;rsquo;t grown, species have not moved or went extinct because of warming. All human related extinctions are due to habitat loss or poaching.</description>
