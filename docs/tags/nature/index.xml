      <title>Parasites of society</title>

      <description>When one organism lives off another organism without benefitting it, we call that parasitism. In nature, parasites often only consume an optimal part of the production output of an organism, preferably without the host noticing. Parasites target a balance between their gain and danger to the host. Taking too much can endanger the ecosystem of the parasites. In society, there are whole classes of people with little output of their own, some wielding great power without responsibility.</description>

      <description>I work on the frontlines of tropical forests protection, right there where the chainsaws and the fires delete pristine forests the size of countries. During my work, I have never seen any signs of damage caused by climate change. At this moment, the destruction of tropical forests is at an all time high and accellerating, and yet very few people care, because their focus has been diverted.

Seasides haven&amp;rsquo;t grown, species have not moved or went extinct because of warming.</description>

      <title>Nature suffers because of the climate hysteria</title>

      <description>Watching the destruction of our planet on the travels to tropical expeditions is rough. It always hurts, and it makes many of us biologists cynical about the future. When in the tropics, we are constantly terrorized by the destruction of what we love and therefore study. It is like we are forced to watch our loved ones suffer. Most of us know very well that the most peopleâ€™s love for nature has been hijacked and that this is the result.</description>
