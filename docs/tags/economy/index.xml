      <description>When one organism lives off another organism without benefitting it, we call that parasitism. In nature, parasites often only consume an optimal part of the production output of an organism, preferably without the host noticing. Parasites target a balance between their gain and danger to the host. Taking too much can endanger the ecosystem of the parasites. In society, there are whole classes of people with little output of their own, some wielding great power without responsibility.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; Swindling with the future of energy &amp;ndash; I find it difficult to accept that in our modern technological society, we promote the use of old and outdated technologies such as solar cells and wind driven dynamoâ€™s. These sources of energy are inferior to what we are currently capable of. Oddly enough, during what is perceived a crisis, the climate lobby has turned the tables on technology, which is now following the lead of swindlers.</description>
