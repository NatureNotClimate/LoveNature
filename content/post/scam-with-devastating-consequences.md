Nowhere in nature will you find evidence of damage because of a hotter climate. Seasides haven't expanded, species have not moved or went extinct becasue of that. All human related extinctions are due to habitat loss or poaching. After 200 years of CO2 increasing, there are only predictions, nothing real has happened yet. Temperature measurements of the last years are much lower than predicted with the scary models.

CO2 causes no damage at all. It has a beneficial effect on plants, and plants have been growing more and healthier because of the extra nutrition. The last 1000 years temperatures have repeatedly went from cold to warm and back. Nature is used to that. It is not used to being cut down at an industrial scale. The global warming is not just nonsense, it effectively obstructs the conservation of nature.

The loss of tropical forests has indeed warmed our climate, and that has only increased because of the climate scare. Don’t believe me?

It is almost impossible to have your voice be heard when you are a critic of climate change. Even though there are vast amounts of scientists in the field who are [skeptical on climate change], who dare not speak because fearing going against the consensus. We’ve all heard of the [97% consensus], which is a blatant forgery. Just this year, again, scientists concluded that it is cloud coverage that determines the warmth of the atmosphere, not the negligible effect of CO2. Read for yourself in [this new study] I cite:

“We have proven that the GCM-models used in IPCC report AR5 cannot compute correctly the natural component included in the observed global temperature. The reason is that the models fail to derive the influences of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature. A too small natural component results in a too large portion for the contribution of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. That is why IPCC represents the climate sensitivity more than one order of magnitude larger than our sensitivity 0.24°C. Because the anthropogenic portion in the increased CO2 is less than 10 %, we have practically no anthropogenic climate change. The low clouds control mainly the global temperature.”

If we focus on climate change, what will happen is that we forget that the forests are being cut at record paces, which in turn produce less clouds, which heats the earth. What do you think is going to happen when we cut two thirds of all tropical forests? This gives more fuel for climate hysterics, which repeats this cycle. Meanwhile, huge sums of money are confiscated from the population, in the name of renewable energy: the energy source that is so bad, that it will never come close to obtaining us 5% of necessary energy to keep humanity going. 

The result of this climate scare is a perfect storm: more power to politicians and banks, logging is still at record highs and the oil industry is really happy that there is no serious competition from new technologies.
