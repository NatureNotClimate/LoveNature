I work on the frontlines of tropical forests protection, right there where the chainsaws and the fires delete pristine forests the size of countries. During my work, I have never seen any signs of damage caused by climate change. At this moment, the destruction of tropical forests is at an all time high and [accellerating], and yet very few people care, because their focus has been diverted.

Seasides haven't grown, species have not moved or went extinct because of warming. All human related extinctions are due to habitat loss or poaching. After 200 years of CO2 increasing, there are only predictions, nothing real has happened yet. Temperature measurements of the last few years are much lower than predicted with the scary models. So why are we sacrificing nature to save it? Real nature is being cut down while we are preoccupied with untrue speculations.

It is almost impossible to have your voice be heard when you are a critic of climate change. Even though there are vast amounts of scientists in the field who are [skeptical on climate change], who dare not speak because fearing going against the consensus. We’ve all heard of the [97% consensus], which is a blatant forgery. Just this year, again, scientists concluded that it is cloud coverage that determines the warmth of the atmosphere, not the negligible effect of CO2. Read for yourself in [this new study] I cite:

*“We have proven that the GCM-models used in IPCC report AR5 cannot compute correctly the natural component included in the observed global temperature. The reason is that the models fail to derive the influences of low cloud cover fraction on the global temperature. A too small natural component results in a too large portion for the contribution of the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. That is why IPCC represents the climate sensitivity more than one order of magnitude larger than our sensitivity 0.24°C. Because the anthropogenic portion in the increased CO2 is less than 10 %, we have practically no anthropogenic climate change. The low clouds control mainly the global temperature.”*

The last 1000 years temperatures have repeatedly went from cold to warm and back. Nature is used to that. CO2 even has a beneficial effect on plants. However, nature is not used to being cut down at an industrial scale. Global warming is not only a waste of time, it interferes with effective preservation of planet and people. The true damage to nature is done with fire and chainsaws. The loss of tropical forests has indeed warmed our climate, which is increasing because of the climate scare, now our attention is averted and palm oil and other bio-fuels have to be grown on the rich soils of burnt down forests.

If we focus on climate change, what will happen is that we forget that the forests are being cut at record paces, which in turn produce less clouds, which heats the earth. What do you think is going to happen, having cut down two thirds of all tropical forests? Painfully, this gives more fuel for climate hysterics, and this repeats this destructive cycle. We won't have any nature to protect in 20 years, if we continue like this.

Meanwhile, huge sums of money are confiscated from economies, in the name of renewable energy: the energy source that is so bad, that it will never come close to obtaining us 5% of necessary energy to keep humanity going. The result of this climate scare is a perfect storm: more power to politicians and banks, logging is still at record highs and the oil industry is really happy that there is no serious competition from new technologies. All the while we really need these new advancements. Remember, we only have one third tropical forests left...
